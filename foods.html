        The classification of food is based on macronutrients and
        micronutrients. Macronutrients usually include water, fiber, fats,
        proteins, and carbohydrates. They are needed for our bodies in large
        quantities. Micronutrients include vitamins and minerals. They are
        needed in our bodies in much fewer quantities.

        <h2>Carbohydrates</h2>
        <p>
          Carbohydrates, or carbs, are sugar molecules. Along with proteins and
          fats, carbohydrates are one of three main nutrients found in foods and
          drinks. Your body breaks down carbohydrates into glucose. Glucose, or
          blood sugar, is the main source of energy for your body's cells,
          tissues, and organs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Carbohydrates include essential nutrients like sugars, starches and
          fiber. Your body uses carbs to make glucose (blood sugar) for energy.

        <p>
          naturally occurring, extremely complex substance that consists of
          amino acid residues joined by peptide bonds. Proteins are present in
          all living organisms and include many essential biological compounds
          such as enzymes, hormones, and antibodies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Proteins are important nutrients that contain the essential and
          non-essential amino acids which provide the body with energy.

        <h2>fats and oil</h2>
        <p>
          What Are Fats and Oils? Some people think that fats and oils are
          different things. But in reality, they share a common chemical
          structure and similar properties. The difference is that those that
          stay solid at room temperatures are called fats while those that stay
          liquid at room temperatures are called oils.
        </p>
        <p>
          The oil and fat products used for edible purposes can be divided into
          two distinct classes: liquid oils, such as olive oil, peanut oil,
          soybean oil, or sunflower oil; and plastic fats, such as lard,
          shortening, butter, and margarine. The physical nature of the fatty
          material is unimportant for some uses, but the consistency is a matter
          of consequence for other products.

        <h2>Vitamins</h2>
        <p>
          Vitamins and minerals are micronutrients required by the body to carry
          out a range of normal functions. However, these micronutrients are not
          produced in our bodies and must be derived from the food we eat.
          Vitamins are organic substances that are generally classified as
          either fat soluble or water soluble.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vitamins and minerals are organic compounds that are required in very
          small amounts, for a variety of metabolic processes.

        <h2>Minerals</h2>
        <p>
          A natural substance with distinctive chemical and physical properties,
          composition, and atomic structure. The definition of an economic
          mineral is broader, and includes minerals, metals, rocks and
          hydrocarbons (solid and liquid) that are extracted from the earth by
          mining, quarrying and pumping.
        </p>
        <p>
          An element or chemical compound that is normally crystalline and that
          has been formed as a result of geological processes.

        <h2>Water</h2>
        <p>
          Water is the most important component of life, which is needed by
          human beings and needed for animals, birds, trees, etc. It exists in
          three different forms on the earth, i.e., solid, liquid, and gas.
          Water exists in the form of ice (solid), and water vapour (gaseous)
          forms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Water is a precondition of life. Besides various uses of water, it is
          mainly used in irrigation as India is an agricultural.
