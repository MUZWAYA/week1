      <h1>Classes of Food</h1>
      <p>The classification of food is based on macronutrients and micronutrients. Macronutrients usually include water, fiber, fats, proteins, and carbohydrates. They are needed for our bodies in large quantities. Micronutrients include vitamins and minerals. They are needed in our bodies in much fewer quantities.</p>
      <section>
        <h2>Carbohydrates</h2>
        <p>Carbohydrates, or carbs, are sugar molecules. Along with proteins and fats, carbohydrates are one of three main nutrients found in foods and drinks. Your body breaks down carbohydrates into glucose. Glucose, or blood sugar, is the main source of energy for your body's cells, tissues, and organs.</p>
        <p>Carbohydrates include essential nutrients like sugars, starches and fiber. Your body uses carbs to make glucose (blood sugar) for energy.</p>

        <h2>Proteins</h2>
        <p>naturally occurring, extremely complex substance that consists of amino acid residues joined by peptide bonds. Proteins are present in all living organisms and include many essential biological compounds such as enzymes, hormones, and antibodies.</p>
        <p> Proteins are important nutrients that contain the essential and non-essential amino acids which provide the body with energy.</p>

        <h2>fats</h2>
        <p>The foods we eat contain nutrients that provide energy and other substances the body needs. Most of the nutrients in food fall into three major groups: proteins, fats, and carbohydrates.</p>
        <p>The body uses fat as a fuel source, and fat is the major storage form of energy in the body. Fat also has many other important functions in the body, and a moderate amount is needed in the diet for good health. Fats in food come in several forms, including saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated. Too much fat or too much of the wrong type of fat can be unhealthy.</p>

        <h2>Vitamins</h2>
        <p>Vitamins and minerals are micronutrients required by the body to carry out a range of normal functions. However, these micronutrients are not produced in our bodies and must be derived from the food we eat. Vitamins are organic substances that are generally classified as either fat soluble or water soluble.</p>
        <p>Vitamins and minerals are organic compounds that are required in very small amounts, for a variety of metabolic processes.</p>

        <h2>Minerals</h2>
        <p>natural substance with distinctive chemical and physical properties, composition, and atomic structure. The definition of an economic mineral is broader, and includes minerals, metals, rocks and hydrocarbons (solid and liquid) that are extracted from the earth by mining, quarrying and pumping.</p>
        <p> an element or chemical compound that is normally crystalline and that has been formed as a result of geological processes.</p>

        <h2>Water</h2>
        <p>Water is the most important component of life, which is needed by human beings and needed for animals, birds, trees, etc. It exists in three different forms on the earth, i.e., solid, liquid, and gas. Water exists in the form of ice (solid), and water vapour (gaseous) forms.</p>
        <p>Water is a precondition of life. Besides various uses of water, it is mainly used in irrigation as India is an agricultural.</p>
